**Crypto Quant Dashboard**

A quantitative cryptocurrency analysis dashboard developed using Python, Streamlit, GitHub, and Linux.

This project is part of the Python, Linux and Git module in A4 IF at ESILV.
It includes two main modules:
- Quant A – Ouiam: Single Asset Analysis (BTC-USD)
- Quant B – Erian: Multi-Asset Portfolio (BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL)

**Project Objectives**

- Retrieve real-time cryptocurrency data via API.
- Build a Streamlit dashboard with two interactive pages:
    - Single Asset (strategies + performance metrics)
    - Portfolio (multi-asset correlations + cumulative performance)
- Implement trading strategies (Buy & Hold, Moving Averages…).
- Compute performance metrics (return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown).
- Generate an automated daily report using Linux scripts + cron jobs.
- Use Git properly: branches, pull requests, clean commit history.
- Deploy the application on a Linux server (24/7 uptime).
